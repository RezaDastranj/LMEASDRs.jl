# The parameter estimation

The log-likelihood evaluation for a linear mixed model is detailed in  [Section B.7](https://embraceuncertaintybook.com/linalg.html#sec-lmmtheory). This section provides insights into computational methods used to fit linear mixed models with [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl). The models are optimized by maximizing a profiled log-likelihood, as demonstrated in the mentioned section.

For further information, you may refer to the  [Optimization](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/optimization) section.
